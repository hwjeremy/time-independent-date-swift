# Time Independent Dates in Swift

This library offers `TimeIndependentDate`, a type representing a date
independent of a particular time. It therefore represents approximately 48
hours of real time on Earth.

Most often, it is important that a date also near-precisely represent a point
in time. For that, we have `Foundation.Date`. `TimeIndependentDate` fills a
gap where, in limited circumstances, we need to deal with a date independent
of time. This is particularly useful when interfacing with third party
systems which supply dates independent of time.
